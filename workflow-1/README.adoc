= Workflow 1

This simple workflow is based on the draft provided by David Wright.

== Usage

. Set up ~/turbine-output (see ../README.adoc)
. Locate your data directory.  The scripts call this "userdir" +
  For example, /lustre/atlas/proj-shared/csc249/wozniak which contains the
  axitinib directory
. Run:
+
----
./run-titan-compute.sh <userdir>
----
. Inspect the outputs:
.. The two output files in TURBINE_OUTPUT contain the main stdout from the workflow
.. The log files in the userdir contain output from the namd2 executable as redirected by namd.sh

== Next steps

. Change run-titan-compute.sh:WALLTIME for longer runs
. We are running NAMD2 with default settings: need to check if all cores are being used efficiently
. The drug is hard-coded to "axitinib"- does this need to change?
